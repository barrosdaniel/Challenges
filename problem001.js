// Sum "A+B"
// Problem #1 

// Since starting could be hard sometimes, let us try the simplest problem possible. The goal is to have practice on submitting answers etc.
// We need to sum two numbers and tell the result. Though you can do it manually, try to write a simple program in any language you know, or like, or want to learn.

var input = '15064 11967';
var inputArray = input.split(' ');
var sum = parseInt(inputArray[0]) + parseInt(inputArray[1]);
